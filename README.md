# PurgatoryTheme
## Purgatory Blender Theme Pack

My personal Blender theme. For people who appreciate gray themes, zen, calmness, readability, and like the balance between too dark themes and too bright ones and prefer easiness on their eyes when working both in dark and bright environments. An updated version of my Purgatory theme. Enjoy.

Compatible with every version of Blender from 2.8+ and up.


## Installation :

Either apply the theme in preferences or drop it into your scripts/presets/interface_theme folder and then pick it in preferences.


### Preferred interface font to use this theme:
